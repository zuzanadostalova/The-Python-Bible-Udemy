# Section 4: Numbers in Python
# 12. lesson - Overview of the section Numbers
# comp will do math for you, learn how to control the order of the computations,
# learn about floats

# make a health potion for a video game character
# use numbers to create difficulty system
# learn about using External Python modules

# 13. lesson - Basic Arithmetic, Floats, and Modulo
# Basic mathematical operations, Modulo function, the float variable type,
# Learn the difference between Python 2 and 3
# mathematical operator - symbol performing mathematical operations 
# Python 2 - division gives an integer input whereas Py3 gives a float (fixed many problems)
# type(0.5) 
# <class "float"> - higher precision with float taking more memory

# Modulo - %, shift 5 on Windows, shift = Mac
# 5 % 3; the output is 2 ... 5 / 3 = three will go to five once with remainder of two 
# 10 % 2 the output is 0 ... 10 / 2 = two will go to two twice with remainder of zero

# 14. lesson - Ordering Operations
# BODMAS - ordering system, closer to B - higher priority
# Brackets () - executed first
# Order - raising number to power of something else
# Division
# Multiplication
# Addition
# Subtraction

# the correct example: 2 * (5-1) = 8

# 15. lesson - Crafting a health potion
# represent health in simple manner - as a number
health = 50
