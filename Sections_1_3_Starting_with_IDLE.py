# Section 1: Course introduction
# 1. lesson - Lesson structure

# Section 2: Installing Python, getting started
# 2. lesson - Installing Python on Windows

# 3. lesson - Installing Python on Mac
# new github repository
# in VSC open the terminal - cmd + shift + P, Git: Clone, insert URL, choose location on PC
 
# 4. lesson - Installing Python on Linux

# 5. lesson - Meeting IDLE
# Python shell - Help - Python docs
# they do not use VSC
# starting with print functions

# 6. lesson - The secret of programmers
# ask good questions -  QA, in the question title write [HELP], then [SOLVED]
# 1) Observed behaviour, 2) Expected behaviour, 3) Link to code - github, 4) where i think the problem is
# 5) What I have tried, 6) Errors and warnings, 7) Version info, 8) Screenshot - N/A 
# not required

# 7. lesson - Note  about gist.github.com

# Section 3: Variables
# 8. lesson - Overview on starting with Python

# 9. lesson - What is variable?
# variable - stores a value,  little box
# in Java and C its type has to be defined since the start
# name = value ... name of the variable on the left, value on the right 

# 10. lesson - Updating our script
# it is not possible to write 1a = 1, only a1 = 1 and keep them lowercase, without spaces

# variables - for calculations, you can easily add new numbers = shortcut
# appropriate naming - readability
# variables are keeping the code organised, easy to search in, and easier to make changes

# test 1. to revise the learnt information
# Which of these functions is used to see a variables type? 
# type()

# Python is a "dynamically typed" language. What does this mean? 
# The variable type can be changed throughout the program.

# coding challenge
